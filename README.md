# Optimal Pig: Dynamic Programming Solution for the Dice Game

Welcome to Optimal Pig, a project dedicated to solving the dice game Pig using dynamic programming techniques and policy iteration. This project offers a strategic view of the game, demonstrating how to calculate an optimal policy and visualize it through an attractive 3D surface plot.

## Project Overview
Pig is a simple dice game with a surprising amount of depth in terms of strategy. In this project, we aim to leverage dynamic programming and generalized policy iteration to devise an optimal solution to the game.

The centerpiece of this project is a generalized policy iteration (GPI) algorithm that computes the optimal strategy for playing Pig. This strategy is then visualized in a 3D surface plot, allowing for an intuitive understanding of the optimal policy across different game states.
